Animation engine with IK with basic rendering.

Heavily inspired by _Hands-On C++ Game Animation Programming: Learn modern animation techniques from theory to implementation with C++ and OpenGL_ but ported to Rust with WGPU.

To run an example: `cargo run --example <example>` e.g. `cargo run --example leg_ik`.

Quite rough around the edges...
